# S-P_Market_prediction

Stock Analsysis Project:
The aim of this project is to test a data source (signal, second column in data.csv) which claims to be predictive of future returns of the SP500 index (spy_close_price, third column in data.csv). 
We use SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) as a proxy for the SP500 index.
